## APO Light Control

The ultimate solution for your home or office lighting needs using mesh networking and the awesome [MZ_APO](https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/wiki/courses/b35apo/documentation/mz_apo/start) boards.

Made in collaboration with [a panda](https://github.com/klarajanouskova) as a semster homework.

Can also be run on PCs using SDL2 libraries. Just run `make`.
